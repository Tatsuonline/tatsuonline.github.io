      <description>Introduction I was recently sent a comedic video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlLcBQPQ96Q&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be) from a friend and I noticed a lot of issues in the topics discussed as jokes. I thought it would be worth it to go through some of them and see if they hold up against the facts. I have divided up the points into some smaller claims made throughout the video and a larger one that is the real issue to be discussed.</description>

      <description>Introduction A Measure Of Satisfaction In The Government Consider the following premises:
Premise 0: People are satisfied in political systems that work as they are intended.
Premise 1: The intent of democratic systems is for participating citizens to vote for policies to be enacted that benefit or interest them the most.
Premise 2: In a democratic republic, citizens vote to elect politicians that will create and support policies that are in the citizen&amp;rsquo;s benefit or interest.</description>

      <description>Note: I am not a medical professional and I have no background in medical science; please consult public health agencies like the CDC or WHO for actual medical information. This post was just written for a co-worker.
Introduction Recently, I had a discussion with a co-worker who told me that there was a lot of misinformation going around about mask usage and that he believed that masks were ineffective&amp;ndash; or at least not as effective as public health agencies claim.</description>

      <description>Introduction Over the last few years, the online video-sharing platform YouTube has been subject to a series of policy changes that have had a profound effect on the type of content and the types of ideas that are expressed or discussed by creators on the platform. Through examples and comparisons, I will attempt to argue that YouTube has fallen prey to the same fiscal compulsions that led to the censorship of printed media in the United States during its &amp;ldquo;golden era&amp;rdquo; of the early nineteenth century.</description>

      <description>Introduction Earlier this month, United States Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill on the floor, the so-called EARN IT Act. The title of the bill is a backronym which spells out &amp;ldquo;E liminating A busive and R ampant N eglect of I nteractive T echnologies&amp;rdquo;. The purported goal of this bill is to establish a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention; however, the bill also exploits the general lack of public understanding of the technology behind encryption in an effort to eliminate its use.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Maxwell&#39;s Equations</title>

      <description>Introduction There are a few times in physics when the equations describing physical phenomena are surprisingly simple and beautiful as a result. Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations are an excellent example of this; with just four equations, all of classical electromagnetism can be described.
In differential form1, they are as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1} \nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2} \nabla \cdot B = 0 \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3} \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \end{equation}</description>
